Emojis have become an integral part of modern communication...., and their significance is growing with each passing day. In today's digital age, emojis are often used to express emotions, feelings, opinions, and reactions. These tiny icons have revolutionized the way we communicate with each other, transforming our messages from plain text to visually expressive conversations. In this essay, I will explore the history of emojis, their significance, and how they are changing the way we communicate.

Emojis, or emoticons, have been around since the dawn of the internet era. In 1982, computer scientist Scott Fahlman introduced the first emoticon, a smiley face, which he intended to use to indicate humorous or sarcastic comments. Since then, thousands of emoticons and emojis have been created, ranging from simple facial expressions such as smiles, frowns, and winks to more complex objects, activities, and animals.

Emojis have several significant impacts on our communication. Firstly, emojis help convey emotions, which can sometimes be challenging to interpret in written text. For instance, a text message that reads "I am doing fine" could be interpreted as being sarcastic, without the use of an emoji. However, by adding a smiley face emoji at the end, it immediately changes the tone of the message and helps clarify the intended meaning. Secondly, emojis build a connection between the sender and the receiver of the message. By sending an emoji, the sender can convey a message that is more than just words. The recipient of the message can understand the intention behind the message, which helps create a sense of empathy and understanding.

There are also some negative impacts of using emojis. For example, some might argue that using too many emojis can diminish the quality of our written communication. In addition, if used improperly, emojis can lead to misunderstandings or even negative outcomes. Thus, it is essential to use emojis appropriately to enhance communication effectively.

In conclusion, emojis have become an important aspect of modern communication, which has transformed our messages from simple text to visually expressive conversations. Their significance lies in their ability to convey emotions and establish connections between people. Understanding how and when to use emojis is of utmost importance to make the best use of digital communication today, helping us create a more empathetic world.

Negative statements
We form negative statements with not or n‚Äôt after be, modal and auxiliary verbs. n‚Äôt is the contracted form of not. In informal language we can add n‚Äôt, without a space, to be, to modal verbs (except may) and to auxiliary verbs (do and have). The negative contracted form of will is won‚Äôt. The uncontracted form of can + not is cannot.

Jan isn‚Äôt coming. She‚Äôs not feeling very well.

She might not be joking!! It could be true.

They don‚Äôt go to school on Wednesday afternoons.

Living in a small flat does not make it easy to have pets.

I hadn‚Äôt decided whether to take the train or go in the car.

They can‚Äôt be hungry again!! They‚Äôve only just eaten.

Negative questions
We use not or n‚Äôt to form negative questions. When there is no modal verb or be, we use auxiliary verb do + n‚Äôt (don‚Äôt, do not, doesn‚Äôt, does not, didn‚Äôt):

Why didn‚Äôt you ask Linda..?

What don‚Äôt you understand...?

Won‚Äôt we able to see the film..?
